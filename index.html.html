      <p><img id="bio-image" src="ReginaDaughter.jpg" alt="Regina">I'm half Russian and half Jewish. I grew up in Los Angeles with a widowed mother who didn't speak great English. Summer in Russia is awesome. I spend a lot of time in college trying to figure out what career I wanted to pursue. A Master's Degree in Philosophy later, I'm still not entirely sure about my path. Last year, I graduated from a relationship coaching progam. Now I'm here learning web development. I'm quite fond of being a mom, though for a bit, I wasn't sure how that was going to go. My ten-year-old is quite the magical creature. Married life is nice. I like getting back rubs. I finally convinced him to run half-marathons with me, though he refused to go for the full enchilada,which I run in Sacramento each December. We are crazy about traveling.
