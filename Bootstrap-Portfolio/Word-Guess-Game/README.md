Word Guess Game
The purpose of this assignment was to create a word guess game using Javascript.

How to Play:

Press any Alpha key (A-Z, a-z) to start game. Non alpha keys are ignored. The theme of the game is 'Scary Movies.' The game will randomly select a scary movie title form its internal list. It will then display a blank word using underscores to represent the letters in the word. 

If a correct letter is guessed, the game will reveal the letter in its correct location. If an incorrect letter is selected, then it will add the letter to a list on incorrectly guessed letters and decrement the remaining guesses count.

If the user guesses the correct movie name before remaining guesses equal zero, then the game increments the number of wins and restarts the game by selecting a new random scary movie name and reseting the game parameters.

If the user does not guess the correct scary movie name within the allocated number of guesses, then the game increments the number of losses before it restarts the game.
